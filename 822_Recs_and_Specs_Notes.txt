* Cost of requirement changes/errors
	* Cost of errors or changes to requirements grows between
	2-10 times between each stage of software lifespan
	* Software lifespan: requirements gathering, design,
	implementation, testing, user-acceptance testing,
	deployment, maintenance
* When we're working on our class projects, what first goes into
the project?
	* Inputs and outputs, bugs (haha)
* What is a requirement? Examples
	* Inputs, outputs, functions, attributes of the system and 
	the environment
** Rafal actually said "Yo go check it out!" ** 
* What makes Yo worth anything?
	* It's simple
	* Can be used for anything depending on group context
	* Kind of like a pager
	* Inputs: network of friends that we want to alert
	* Outputs: yo
	* Attribute of system: fast sending/receiving of messages
* Requirements Management
	* A systematic approach to eliciting, organizing,
	documenting requirements and a process establishing and
	maintaining agreement on how they are changed
	* Whole standards (ISO 9000) have been developed around
	this
		* ISO = International Organization for Standardization
* Management Responsibility

	understood, implemented, and maintained.
	* Responsibilities and authorities for all personnel
	specifying, achieving, and monitoring quality shall be
	defined
	* In-House verification resources shall be defined, trained,
	and funded
	* ??? 
* Quality System
	* Procedures shall be prepared and implemented
	* Toyota realized that their robots weren't able to improve
	quality, just maintain it. So they hired people to watch the
	robots to try and improve quality or something
* Contract Review
	* Incoming contracts and POs shall be reviewed to see
	whether the requirements are adequately defined, agree with 
	the bid and can be supplied
* Design control (comes after requirements)
	* Design project shall be plan
	* input parameters shall be defined
	* output including curcial product characteristics shall be
	documented
	* Output shall be verified to meet input requirements
	* Changes shall be controlled
* Document control
	* Generation, distribution, changes of/to documents shall be
	controlled.
** All assignments in this class will be turned in through git **
** Assignments will be done in markdown **
* Purchasing
	* Potential subcontractors and subsuppliers shall be
	evaluated for their ability to provide stated requirements
	* Requirements shall be clearly defined in contracting data
	* Effectiveness of the subcontractor's quality assurance
	system shall be assessed
** We just received the first "say yes" of the semester ** 
* Customer suuplied material
	* Any customer supplied material shall be protected against
	loss or damage
* Product identification and traceability
	* The products shall be indentified and traceable by item,
	batch, or lot during all stages of production, delivery, 
	and installation.
* Process control
	* Production and installation processes shall be defined
	and planned
	* Production shall be carried out under controlled
	conditions: documented instructions, in process controlls,
	approval of processes and equipment, and criteria for
	workmanship.
	* Special processes that cannot be verified after the fact
	shall be monitored and controlled throughout the processes
* Inspection and testing
	* Incoming materials shall be inspected or verified before
	use
	* In process inspection and testing shall be performed
	* Final inspection and testing shall be performed prior
	to release of finished product
	* records of inspection shall be kept
* Inspection/measuring/test equipment
	* Equiptment used to demonstrate conformance shall be
	controlled, calibrated, and maintained
	* Identify measurements to be made
	* Identify affected instruments
	* Calibrate instruments
	* Periodically check calibration
	* Assess measurement validity if found out of calibration
	* Control environmental conditions in metrology lab
	* Measurement ???
	* ???
* Inspection and test status
	* Status of inspections and tests shall be maintained for
	items as they progress through various processing steps
	* Records shall show who released conforming product
* Control of nonconforming product
	* nonconforming products shall be controlled to prevent
	inadvertent use or installation
	* Review and disposition of nonconforming products shall be
	formalized
* Corrective action
	* Problem causes shall be identified
	* Specific problems and their causes shall be corrected
	* Effectiveness of corrective actions shall be assessed
* Handling, storage, packaging, delivery
	* Procedures for these things shall be developed and 
	maintained
	* Handling controls shall prevent damage and deterioration
	* Secure storage shall be provided. Product in stock shall
	be checked for deterioration
	* ???
	* ???
* Quality records
	* Quality records shall be identified, collected, indexed,
	filed, stored, maintained, and dispositioned
* Internal quality audits
	* Audits shall be planend and performed
	* Results shall be communicated to management
	* Deficiencies found shall be corrected
* Training
	* Training needs shall be identified
	* Training shall be provided
	* Some tasks may require qualified individuals
	* Records of training shall be maintained
* Servicing
	* Servicing activies shall be performed to written
	procedures
	* Servicing activies shall meet requirements
* Requirements management
	* Think of requirements as a three stage process
	* First: understand the customers' need in the context of
	the problem domain
	* Next: software feature must be envisioned to meet that
	need
	* Finally: requirements to constrain and define that feature
