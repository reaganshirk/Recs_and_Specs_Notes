* Three areas when using GitHub
	* Working area
		* move from working to staging: add
	* Staging area
		* move from staging to repository: commit
	* Repository
	* Remote didn't enter picture here, probably will today?
		* You can have more than one remote, but how? We're
		gonna get there as well
* How many different versions of one file can you have?
	* 3. One in the working area, staging area, and repo
	* In the repo, you can have as many versions as the number
	of commits you've made
	* One file with 10 commits, how many different versions of
	that file can you handle?
		* 12. 10 copies in repo, one in staging area, one in 
		working area.
* nano <file name> creates and allows you to edit the new file
* git status <file name> gives git status of the individual file
* How can we compare the three versions of a file? (working,
staging, repo versions)
	* cat <file name>
	* git diff <file name>
* Red and green aren't a good choice of colors because there are
a lot of people who are color blind (not really relevant to
lecture but it makes me giggle that he brought it up)
* Is there significance in the number next to commit after typing
"git log"?
	* Yes but I didn't hear what he said it was, maybe something
	about hash?
	* Yes, it's a hash number!
* git branch tells you which branch you're on
* git fetch fetches from the cloud?
* git diff master origin/master <file name> shows the changes
made in the cloud post fetching
* commit messages should encompass changes made to be of value
when you're looking back at them
* For every assignment we will be assigned a git repo. Our
submitted assignment will be a link to our assigned repo
