* Use Case Overview Diagram
	* Just shows which parts are shared
	* Mainly actors/stereotypes
	* Allows you to see what types of activities are happening
	in the system
* UML Activity Diagrams
	* Easy to follow and most widely used
	* Show a business process
	* Capture branching and decisions
	* Similar to flowcharts
	* Activity is being modeled
	* Action is part of the activity step
	* Part of process view
	* Initial Node: indicated by a full black circle
	* Actions: rounded rectangles indicating
		* performed behaviors
		* computations
		* key steps in process
	* activity final node: indicated by the black circle inside
	an empty circle
	* Arrowed lines indicate start or end: there is a direction
	between activities
		* Incoming = line going into node
		* Outgoing - line exiting the node
	* Diamond shaped nodes are called ??? - equivalent to if
	else statements
	* Diamond shaped nodes that are called ??? - place when
	branches of decisions come into the next common phase
	* Branch edges display guard conditions captured in brackets
* Sorry fam I don't know what the fuck he's talking about rn
	* Aren't we supposed to be working on our group
	assignments??
* Simplifying diagrams
	* Upside down pitchfork indicates a call activity node - 
	similar to calling a procedure 
* Time events
	* Time may be a factor in activity
	* Model a wait period
	* Model a process repeating at the regular interval
