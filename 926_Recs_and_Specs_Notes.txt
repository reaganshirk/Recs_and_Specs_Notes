* Think about calendaring software, who are possible actors, what
is the sequence of events?
	* Everyones ideas for actors/sequence of events will be 
	relatively different even if it achieves the same goal
	* You can easily add your ideas/change the UML diagram shown
	to reflect what you were thinking
	* Actors
		* you
		* coworkers
		* Event APIs...? Didn't think that would be an actor,
		clearly I don't completely understand the definition
		of an actor lol
* Sequence Diagrams with Sequence Fragments
	* Fragment family
		* ref: removing a very complex part of the diagram
		and referencing it somewhere else
		* uml-diagrams.org has good examples of uml diagrams
			* ref example: handling errors on a
			submit_comments diagram
		* assert: I was on groupme and missed the explanation
		sorry
		* loop: literally demonstrates a loop in the diagram
		* break: indicates that you can exit the loop when the
		break condition is met
		* alt: similar to an if statement
		* opt: optional transaction
* Time to work on group graph assignment
