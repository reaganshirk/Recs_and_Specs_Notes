* If there is no license attached to code, what can we officially
do with that code?
	* Contact the owner
		* If there's no license, why bother?
		* What if the owner doesn't get back to us?
	* Do whatever you want
		* No
	* Copyright law or some shit, you do actually have to
	contact the owner of the repo
	* Git highly recommends a README.md and a license 
* How can we prevent git from listing every file when we look at 
git status
	* a .gitignore file
	* inside you put the name(s) of the file(s) you want to
	ignore
	* you can still add files in .gitignore but you have to
	force it (-f)
	* git add -f <filename>
* Git is your friend :)
* Git checkout moves things from repo back into the working area
* Wants all of us to try BitBucket
* Can't do git rm (git remove) on a file that is in the staging
area
